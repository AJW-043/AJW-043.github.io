									<h2>Interactive map</h2>

									<h2>What does this map show?</h2>
																		<p>In the map, notice there are two layers: one with red and green polygons, and a density map. In the first layer, red signals above average bike counts, green signals below average, and yellow is used for the average. This map highlights specific streets which had high numbers of bikes. However, it does not adjust for the length of the street so it does not say much about the bike density.</p>
									<p>The second layer looks at the parked bike density. However, due to the data manipulation steps taken the map is not very informative. To calculate the density, the polygons first had to be converted into a point, which was done by finding the centroid. Yet in doing so, information about the area over which the bikes were spread was lost. As such, this map again provides fun insights into which streets have the most bikes, but no further conclusions can be drawn without further analysis.</p>								
									
									<h2>Takeaways</h2>
									<p>If I were to do this assignment again, I would certainly place more care in understanding how the vector spatial analysis works and what types of data are useful. Polygons were quite inconvenient to work with, and often got the error that it was the wrong type of data for many of the tools. Further, converting the data was not very straightforward. Going from feature to raster and finding centroids helped us evade some of the errors but the results simply were not very meaningful.</p>
